/**
 * Shared Stack.Screen options for every iOS formSheet-presented sheet route.
 *
 * Why these specific values:
 *   - `presentation: "formSheet"` instantiates iOS
 *     UISheetPresentationController — native grabber, stacked-card backdrop,
 *     drag-to-dismiss spring physics, detents.
 *   - `sheetAllowedDetents: [0.6, 0.95]` — explicit numeric detents. The
 *     ergonomic `"fitToContents"` is broken on iOS 26 + Expo 55
 *     (expo/expo#42904 padding inconsistency, expo/expo#42965 zero-size).
 *     Predictable two-snap presentation across every picker-row sheet >
 *     shrink-wrap; this is the right default for sheets that sit next to
 *     other sheets in the same chip row (issue / project AttributeRow) so
 *     the user gets the same gesture regardless of which chip they tap.
 *     Isolated sheets that have no neighbour to be consistent with (e.g.
 *     the workspace `menu` sheet) override this with `"fitToContents"`
 *     to avoid the large blank area below their content.
 *   - `sheetGrabberVisible: true` — surfaces the iOS native drag handle
 *     so users discover the gesture.
 *   - `contentStyle.height: "100%"` — safety net against the same
 *     zero-size class of bugs above; ensures the sheet body fills the
 *     allotted detent.
 *   - `headerShown: false` — every sheet body draws its own header (title
 *     + optional right action). The native Stack header would double up.
